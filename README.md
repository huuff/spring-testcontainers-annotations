# Spring Testcontainers Annotation
Autoconfigure testcontainers for Spring Boot tests

### Deprecated?
I did this without realizing there was a parallel work to do the same scheduled for release in Spring Boot 3.1.0, so maybe this is already deprecated? [See the relevant issue here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/34658)
